# Windows-Backdoor-AES
I reworked the Go Windows Backdoor to use AES encryption.

A simple Windows backdoor, It uses TCP connections to communicate between the Server and Client. 
Data in encrypted in AES, The KEY is auto generated on first connect.
This is a Command Prompt backdoor.
Send command "exit" to have the backdoor close.
